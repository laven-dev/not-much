This is a modified version of the Hugo theme [not-much](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/not-much/ "not-much") by [Giosuè Sulipano](https://giosuesulipano.it/).

This theme implements [notice shortcodes](https://github.com/gethugothemes/hugo-modules/tree/master/shortcodes/notice), the font [Hermit](https://pcaro.es/hermit/), the [Ayu Mirage](https://ayutheme.com/) colour scheme, and some minor tweaks here and there.

For a more in depth demo site, check out the original ```not-much``` theme. Nearly everything here works the same.
