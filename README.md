# not much lav

`not-much-lav` is a modification to the Hugo theme `not-much`.
The main modifications are the inclusion of the Ayu Mirage colour theme, the font Hermit, notice shortcodes, and a few extra tweaks.

Check out the original theme to get all the information you would need about the theme, I've cut a lot of it out here.
